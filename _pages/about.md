I'm a Ph.D. student in school psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  My research 
and clinical interests involve the application of evidence-based practices in the areas of school mental 
health, behavioral interventions, child maltreatment, and prevention. 

I currently am an advanced practicum student at the UMass Psychological Services Center 
where I am on a team that provides behavioral consultation and Positive Behavior Interventions 
& Supports (PBIS) technical assistance to local schools. I also volunteer as a counselor/advocate 
for the Hampshire County rape crisis center and as a case reviewer for the Department of 
Children and Families Foster Care Unit.

I have experience working in a number of k-12 schools, a behavioral treatment residence, 
a homeless shelter, and college residence halls. Much of my work has been with children and 
young adults who have substantial social, emotional, and behavioral challenges - both directly 
and through supporting their teachers and paraprofessionals.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received a masters degree in Social Justice Education 
from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and a bachelors in English & Comparative 
Literature from Columbia University, where I also studied for my teaching license.
